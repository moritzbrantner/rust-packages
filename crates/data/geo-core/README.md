# geo-core

Format-agnostic geospatial domain types, geometry helpers, and transforms for
video-analysis.

This crate owns stable internal concepts such as coordinates, bounding boxes,
geometry, features, collections, and geometry simplification. It intentionally
does not depend on GeoJSON or expose wire-format crate types.

## Install

```toml
[dependencies]
geo-core = { package = "moritzbrantner-geo-core", version = "0.1.0" }
```

```rust
use geo_core::{Coordinate, Geometry};
```

## Package surface

Primary workflow: `geo.distance`.

Workflow operations:

- `geo.bounds`: Computes bounds and coordinate counts for an internal geometry document.
- `geo.distance`: Computes haversine meters or planar coordinate-unit distance between lon/lat coordinates.

Debug operations:

- `describe`: inspect package metadata and runtime support.

Runtime support: library, CLI, server, and WASM wrappers expose these operations.

Run the primary workflow through the CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p moritzbrantner-geo-core-cli -- run \
  --operation geo.distance \
  --json '{"from":[8.0,49.0],"mode":"haversine","to":[9.0,49.0]}'
```

Successful responses use the shared package-surface shape with `operation`,
`title`, `message`, `summary`, and `result`. Default surface calls are
deterministic, local-first, and do not download models, write persistent files,
or execute external tools unless an operation explicitly documents native or
external-tool execution.
